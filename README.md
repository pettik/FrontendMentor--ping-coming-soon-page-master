## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out that newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools I liked to help me complete the challenge. So if I had something I wanted to practice, I gave it a go.

My users should have been able to:

- Add their email and submit the form ‚úÖ
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form ‚úÖ
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty ‚úÖ
  - The email address is not formatted correctly ‚úÖ
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size ‚úÖ
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page ‚úÖ
